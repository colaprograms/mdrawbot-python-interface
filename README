Here are some programs to control the mDrawBot.
They connect to the serial port /dev/ttyS0, so make sure that the user
has permission to open it (e.g. add them to dialout group)

IMPORTANT:

For these programs to work, the robot must start as high as possible
and roughly centered under the control block.

The robot keeps track of where it is, and it will get confused if it starts
in the wrong place, so it must be tricked to move to the right place.

To do this, use

python3 move.py left 100
python3 move.py left 100
python3 move.py right 50
python3 move.py left 10
(etc)

to roughly centre the robot under the control block, and then use

python3 move.py up
python3 move.py up
python3 move.py up

to move it up bit by bit until the motors start clicking. The motors aren't
strong enough to move it horizontally when it's all the way up, so moving
left and right at the top will probably not work.


Programs:

terminal.py - connect to the mDrawBot and send it terminal commands.

hilbert_curve.py - draw a Hilbert curve of order 7

hopper.py
rossum.py
turing.py - draw pictures of notable computer people

server.py - start a TCP server that takes connections on port 34442.
